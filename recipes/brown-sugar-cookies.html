        <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> 1 cup salted butter (soften, room temp)</li>
                <li> 1 cup brown sugar (packed)</li>
                <li> 2 cups all purpose flour (floured)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2> Steps: </h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven and prepare a baking sheet:</strong> preheat the oven to 350℉ (177℃). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.</li>

            <li><strong>Cream the butter and brown sugar:</strong> using a handheld or stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and brown sugar together on medium to high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.</li>

            <li><strong>Add the flour:</strong> with the mixer on low speed, slowly add the flour to the butter and sugar mixture. Mix until combined.</li>

            <li><strong>Scoop balls of dough onto the baking sheet:</strong> Use a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop to make even-sized balls of cookie dough. If using a food scale, each ball of dough should weigh 40 grams. Roll each ball between your hands to smooth its surface. Then place the balls on the prepared baking sheet at least 2 inches apart so they don't spread into each other as they bake.</li>

            <li><strong>Flatten the balls of dough:</strong> using your hand or the bottom of a glass, gently flatten each ball of dough into discs that are ¼ inch thick.</li>

            <li><strong>Bake the cookies:</strong> place in the oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the edges are crisp and a light golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy!</li>
